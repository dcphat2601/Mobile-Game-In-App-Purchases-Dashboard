# Mobile Game In-App Purchases Dashboard

## Introduction
This is a personal project I made as a student to explore player behavior and monetization patterns in mobile games.  
The dataset is from Kaggle:  
[Mobile Game In-App Purchases Dataset 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pratyushpuri/mobile-game-in-app-purchases-dataset-2025)

I wanted to understand:
- Who spends the most money?
- How do players behave (sessions, age, device)?
- What payment methods or game genres generate the most revenue?

It’s also a practice project for me to improve skills in Power BI, Python, and data storytelling.
